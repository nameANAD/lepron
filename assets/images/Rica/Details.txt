Live the life you love.

First impression: snob, brat, geek, and grumpy. But as time goes by: naturally funny, gives geekish jokes, sometimes harhar yet never lame, a loving anak, nature's pride (my pride, in fact), a constant head-scratcher, and by far the most intelligent Pisaynon batchmate since first year. One of a kind, huh? :) Most of all, the things I really do like about him are his being a very concern son and a very good listener to my problems. *kisses*

The GUY who has read the super-thick-and-small-fonted University Physics book from cover to cover. But beyond that, Looty is as bright as his
brain. He gives rational advises to his friends and comforts them as long as he could. And most of all, he is a very good impersonator of local celebrities in Philippine television and could memorize the advertisements in TV.Bitaw Looty, thank you for you-already-know-what and
wishin' you all the best. God bless you always. Stay cool but don't freeze. ;) Kudos!

Books, Papers and Science is not just Ariel. He's still the boy I knew three years ago but never fails to impress everyone with what he can do not only in academics but to every scholar he has ever encountered. Fun is always in his mind even though many don't appreciate it. He loved it in his way. He always know what he's doing and he's sticking to it. That's ARIEL.
