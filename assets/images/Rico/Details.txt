At a first glance, he looks like the bully in school. But as you spend more time with him, you will learn that he's the ultimate joker making
every person in Pisay happy. He makes you smile everytime you talk. He even inspires your life. I hope that he will become the best director not only in the
country but in the whole world.

Even when you don’t know Bert that much, you know how much fun he is to be with. He is an open-minded dude who is not afraid to show you his ideas. He shows his talentsss frequently in class by performing different solos. Bert has also been a fatherly figure to me, giving advices and cheering me up. Feeling down? Bert’s the man!

If funny jokes were cash, he'd be drowning in cash right now. He's a versatile dancer and a good leader. He's my closest guy friend and I can never ever stay mad at Bert for a long time. There's never a dull moment with this thoughtful, extremely talented and optimistic guy.  Bert is the living definition of contagious happiness. I'll always be your B.H., you... you A.H. :)
