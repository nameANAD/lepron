Dana is everything. She can be fun, loud, crazy, and then serious when it is appropriate (and when she sees I really need silence). She is very direct. She says what she feels or thinks (most of the time). That's just one of the things  I like about her. Dana loves everyone. When she says it, she means it. I really hope she won't change. Stay cool Danat! I love you!

Kokak, hehe. Thank you for all the things that you've done to me. You are a great person with a strong personality. You are very friendly, kind, funny, and supportive. Keep it up, stay cool, be good.

Dana is a very good friend, to the point of spoiling me. She's my ultimate crazy partner-in-crime and she's the only one who always understands what I want to say - even when I don't say it out loud. I have just known her for four years but if you stretch, from end to end, the good memories that I always had with her, it would reach a lifetime. Love you Danat. Don't die, okay? <3
