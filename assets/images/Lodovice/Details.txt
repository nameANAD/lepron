Lodovice, Emmanuel T.

EMAN


-

Motto:

Simplicity is beauty.


-


Genius, sporty, thoughtful, determined, caring, rational, logical, talented, ambitious, funny, silent and serious, but comfortable to be with. Truly an exceptional man and a well-rounded individual. That's Eman! He is a very good man. Kokak! Tralalala.

- Dana

One of the friendly and funny uber-smart guys around. He may be the silent type but he is well-rounded and sporty. A true master of the mind and monster on the hardcourt. He is determined, extremely intelligent, firm, responsible, wise, reliable, fun-loving, and a great friend. He is remembered for almost winning the Great Spelling Duel against Kevin and his unforgettable "flying bags" incident. 

- Michael


Looking at him may give you the impression of a dull, quiet guy who does not know the definition of fun. But when you'll get to know eman, you'll have a really patient and intelligent friend who has staggering basketball moves. He's always willing to listen, and would not let you down.
