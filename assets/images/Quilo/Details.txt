BARBIE

Motto:
Courage does not always roar. Sometimes, it is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying 'I will try again tomorrow.'

People call her Mommy Barbie, Mommy B, or simply just Mommy because of her mother-like figure to the batch. I treat her as a sister though- a sis I have been wanting to have. Cham-cham is the type of person who never runs out of advices, comforting words and care for the people around her. She's good in many things- from dancing and singing to drawing and writing. When you need a friend, just wake her up. :)

Barbarah Jeeeeaaan is a lovely girl. She’s sweet, thoughtful, and a friend to everyone. She has a soft heart that can be abused (Bwahaha!). But she can also be aggressive so be careful. Barbie always lend her shoulder for you to cry on. She’s never boring. She’s also very funny and her ability to impersonate is excellent. She’s very talented specially in dancing. She’s the best. She also loves food… and I love her!

A great dancer with electrifying dance moves, Barbie is a sister figure who is not only gorgeous and uber cute, but more importantly caring, thoughtful, smart and talented. She is remembered for going into hysterical, insatiable crazes when she catches sight of the 'oooh, sparkley!!!' items. A true child at heart who is idealistic, skillful, cheerful, responsible, creative. She surely brings rays of sunshine in everyone's monotonous days.
