Sweet is a determined and headstrong person. When he sets a goal, he will follow the right way to reach the finish line. He is also responsible and a good friend. He often reminds me: “Kie, your project.  DotA can wait.” When you’re with him, it’s impossible not to laugh at his crazy actions and ideas. Sweet, just be you and don’t change. Live high, Supremo.

Aldrin a.k.a Sweet is the MANLY type of guy. He’s very smart and good at doing any boy stuff. Despite his masculine figure, he has a soft heart and a sweet personality. He hates losing but accepts it. He can do anything for the one he loves. He’s a good friend and a funny guy. His jokes are lame but we laugh at it though. He is a trustworthy person and a caring friend.

A student keeping the balance between the physical, mental and social aspect of a person. Sometimes, his friends stand in awe as he makes feats that are impossible for a normal student. "Just your average Pisay student" is an understatement for him since the proper statement should be "not your average Pisay student". Dancing, singing and acting at the same time is just one of the things that puts his friends in shock.
