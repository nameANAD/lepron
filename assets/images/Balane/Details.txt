Dads is a silent and mysterious, but not really shy type of guy. He is the expert in computer science and techie stuff. He’s even the one I run to when there’s something wrong with my cell phone.

A friend is a rare gem. But Arnelle is rarer - he is a friend to all. He's His silence and softness signifies the brilliance of his mind. He can be naughty but that won't make you dislike him. Instead, it will challenge you to be analytic whenever you are around him. Arnelle is not an expressive type of person and this makes him mysterious. But for me, those mysteries and unspoken words never keep you away from him because he is at all times open for anyone. :)
